/**
 * Imports category.
 * This is for crates not intended for goodies, but also not intended for departmental orders.
 * This allows us to have a few crates meant for deliberate purchase through cargo, and for cargo to have a few items
 * they explicitly control. It also holds all of the black market material and contraband material, including items
 * meant for purchase only through emagging the console.
